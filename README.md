Getting started
---------------

You will need to install libprotobuf-dev libraries through your favourite package manager.

Then (as a normal user) at the console run:

```bash
./waf configure --prefix=install
./waf install
```

This will install the binaries to `${PWD}/install/bin`.

Commands

* `speedtests <mode> <dit files>...`: Speed test reading dit files
* `root2stripes [-h|--help] [-t treename] [-m pattern] [file]...`: Explode a root file
* `stripes2root [dit files]...`: inverse of root2stripes 
* `make_test_dit`: Requires `${PWD}/dit_test` directory to exist, builds some test columns
