User story for the NTuple train:

 - I want to create stripes from the datasets <ds1>, which should be saved in the set of datasets <ds2>
 - I want to be able to run a ROOT analysis on some stripes in <ds2>
 - In that analysis, i want to be able to write out a new column, it should be stored in <ds3>
 - I want to be able to run a ROOT analysis on some stripes in <ds2> combined with the stripe in <ds3>

This should hold for all processing:
 - Any corruption in the input files must be detected
 - Any mismatch between input columns must be detected


------------------------------------------------------------

Components of the solution:

 - Generate size<ds1> jobs:
    - direct access/fex/dCache/PANDA stagein of <ds1.1>
    - root2stripes <ds1.1.1> <ds1.1.2> ...
    - zip -r0 dit
    - dq2_put/PANDA stageout

 - Generate size<dataset> jobs
    - resolve required stripes specified as versions into files <dataset>
    - gain direct access to required files in <dataset>
    - gain direct write access to files in <dataset> if possible
    - run code
    - upload result if no direct access was possible

Additional Goal:
 Multiple jobs for a single column, which all process subsets of the column
 This needs jump-seeks into columns for X > 1

Job archetypes:
 - 1 ROOT file -> N Columns 
 - M columns -> 1 ROOT file
 - M columns -> N columns

Nomenclature:
 - SplitUID: Unique ID for each algorithm which produces a variable number of objects.
   Has a string "explanation" which is embedded in the file, but should also be saved centrally
   with more information on what happened and what algorithm was run.
   If the tuple of SplitUIDs is not equal, the columns are probably incompatible.
   [SplitUID1 : "ATLAS runs", SplitUID2 : "ATLAS muon stream events"]
   [SplitUID1 : "ATLAS runs", SplitUID2 : "ATLAS muon stream events", SplitUID3: "Muons from the MuID algorithm"]

 - BlockInfo: Information on the events contained in this block
   - Starting run+event number of the original source
   - Total events in original source
   - Events that have been skipped at the beginning
   - # Events that have been included in this file
