I am an ATLAS analyst, new to the collaboration. 
I want ntuples for all data & mc which i need,
with at least the standard variables
but also variables X, Y and Z.

I am an ATLAS analyst. I want a set of datasets of all data
which i can skim/slim/thin from, and which i can also run over with ROOT.

I am developing a new jet correction factor, but i need that one variable
which is not in my ntuple...

I have just heard of a new jet correction factor. It needs variables
which i do not have in my ntuple. Help!

I have a set of preselection requirements, and would like a ntuple with
only data corresponding to these requirements.
