Core Problems
-------------
* Synchronization of events across columns ("Friend Tree Problem")
* Grid data storage and discovery
* Allow whole event read

Blocks
------
Definition: A "Block" is a set of events (let's say ~10k-100k). Think of it as
a typical amount of events stored in a file.

A block has a fingerprint so that variables belonging to the same block can
be identified. The fingerprint ensures that the _original_ data this event was
generated from is identical (AMI tags therefore also change the fingerprint for
data derived from D3PDs and also for MC).

Estimate of the number of blocks:
simulation / data -> tag -> run [-> lb]
->10(years) * 10(tags) * 200(runs) * 100 (files?) => 2M blocks - too many!?
Blocking per run would yield ~20k data + 70k MC "runs"
=> block namespacing by mc/data, mc tag, data period(?)

Columns
-------
3200 variables in current Photon D3PD
+ 3000(?) in other D3PDs
+ 4000(?) for AOD stuff?
=> ~10k columns (*) versions
Namespaced columns by user.

Files
-----
Drillbit files are plain zip files without compression. In them, column files
(.column) and columninfo (.columninfo) files are stored

A drillbit file contains a metadata/blocks file which contains a list of
blocks that this file contains. It also may contain a metadata/skim/ directory
with files in it that describe skims or thins that have been performed on the
data in this file.

Workflows
---------
Drillbit plans to support the following workflows:
* Convert a ROOT file into a Drillbit file
* Convert Drillbit file(s) into a ROOT file
* Use drillbit to convert a ROOT file into a different ROOT file (testing)
* Perform a skim/slim/thin/repack on drillbit file(s)
* Run a ROOT-based script with TTree adapter on a drillbit file, ROOT output
* Run a given C++ tool with drillbit input and output
* Run an A4 analysis on a drillbit file, A4 output
* Run a native drillbit analysis, drillbit file output
* Request a single column of metadata

[I have a skimmed/thinned D3PD produced somehow and I want another column]

The Databases
-------------
* Record which variables are requested
