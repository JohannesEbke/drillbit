Streaming
---------

Drillbit segments the streaming to and from stripes into two problems:
A) Connecting meta/data bytes from whereever they are to two Coded{I|O}Streams
B) Efficiently dissecting or assembling data from CodedInputStreams

Problem A is currently solved by copying all relevant files to memory and then
hooking up a decompressor and coded stream onto it. If memory consumption
becomes an issue, it should be an easy matter of writing a 
ClosingFileInputStream that does not keep the relevant file open.

Dissection and Assembly
-----------------------

Up to now, dissection and assembly proceeded directly to D3PD std::vectors,
assuming that all fields are individual and not collated into messages.

The next step is to disassemble and reassemble arbitrary protobuf messages.
For disassembly, no additional information is required, but for reassembly,
the structure of the message is required. For now, we assume that this
structure is present somewhere in compiled form.
